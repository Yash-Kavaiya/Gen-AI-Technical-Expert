      "**Common Risks:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Competition:** Both companies operate in intensely competitive markets. Alphabet faces competition in search, advertising, AI, and cloud services, while Amazon competes in retail, e-commerce services, web services, devices, digital content, and logistics. Both companies acknowledge that competitors may have greater resources, longer histories, or greater brand recognition.\n",

      "    *   Geopolitical events and political unrest\n",
      "    *   Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\n",
      "    *   Compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws\n",
      "    *   **Alphabet:** \"Our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results...International revenues accounted for approximately 53% of our consolidated revenues in 2023.\" (10-K, 2024)\n",
      "    *   **Amazon:** \"Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally...Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks...\" (10-K, 2024)\n",
      "*   **Data Security and Privacy:** Both companies handle vast amounts of user data and are subject to increasing scrutiny regarding data privacy and security practices. Breaches or failures to comply with data protection laws could result in significant liabilities and reputational harm.\n",

      "*   **Evolving Government Regulations:** Both companies face a complex and evolving regulatory landscape, particularly concerning data privacy, competition, AI, and online content. Changes in laws or interpretations could significantly impact their business practices and increase compliance costs.\n",
      "    *   **Alphabet:** \"We are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business.\" (10-K, 2024)\n",

      "\n",
      "**Amazon-Specific Risks:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Fulfillment Network and Logistics:** Amazon's business relies heavily on its fulfillment network and logistics capabilities. Failures to adequately predict demand, optimize operations, or manage relationships with shipping companies could negatively impact its business.\n",
      "    *   \"Failures to adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending patterns or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business.\" (10-K, 2024)\n",
      "*   **Supplier Relationships:** Amazon's reliance on suppliers, including limited or single-source suppliers, exposes it to risks related to availability, pricing, and ethical sourcing.\n",

      "*   **Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers:** Amazon faces risks related to fraudulent or unlawful activities by sellers on its platform, which could lead to liability and reputational damage.\n",
      "    *   \"Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods...\" (10-K, 2024)\n",
      "*   **Inventory Risk:** Amazon is exposed to significant inventory risks due to seasonality, new product launches, and changes in consumer demand.\n",
      "    *   \"We are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in customer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors.\" (10-K, 2024)\n",

      "Over the past three years, Home Depot has consistently emphasized its position as the world's largest home improvement retailer and its commitment to providing a wide assortment of products and services to both DIY and professional customers. However, there are some notable changes in how the company describes its business and strategic priorities:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Focus on Interconnected Shopping Experience:** All filings emphasize the importance of creating an interconnected, frictionless shopping experience that blends the digital and physical worlds. This includes investments in websites, mobile apps, and store enhancements to cater to customers who research online and purchase in-store or vice versa.\n",
      "*   **Emphasis on Pro Customers:** There's a growing emphasis on catering to professional customers (Pros) by providing customized online experiences, dedicated sales forces, broader product assortments, extensive delivery networks, loyalty programs, and enhanced credit offerings. The company is investing in capabilities to serve Pros' complex purchase needs, including expanded supply chain capabilities, additional trade credit, and enhanced order management systems.\n",
      "*   **Supply Chain Investments:** All filings highlight ongoing investments in the supply chain to ensure product availability and improve delivery speed and reliability. Home Depot is expanding its distribution and fulfillment network to offer same-day or next-day delivery to a larger portion of the U.S. population.\n",
      "*   **Corporate Responsibility and Human Capital Management:** There's an increasing focus on corporate responsibility, particularly in the areas of environmental sustainability and human capital management. Home Depot organizes its efforts around three pillars: Focus on Our People, Operate Sustainably, and Strengthen Our Communities. This includes initiatives to reduce environmental impact, promote diversity and inclusion, and support communities through The Home Depot Foundation.\n",
      "*   **Acquisition of SRS:** In the 2025 filing, Home Depot mentions the acquisition of SRS, a leading residential specialty trade distribution company. This acquisition is aimed at accelerating growth with Pros by offering specialized products and services to roofers, landscapers, and pool contractors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Quotes from SEC Filings:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **2025 10-K:** \"In fiscal 2024, we acquired SRS, a leading residential specialty trade distribution company engaged in the distribution of residential and commercial roofing products, complementary building products, landscape supplies and swimming pool supplies serving the professional roofer, landscaper, and pool contractor.\"\n",
      "*   **2024 10-K:** \"We serve two primary customer groups — consumers (including both DIY and DIFM customers) and professional customers — and have developed varying approaches to meet their diverse needs...We have a number of initiatives designed to drive growth with Pros\".\n",
      "*   **2023 10-K:** \"Our ability to operate successfully and meet the needs of our customers was due in significant part to our investments over the past several years aimed at creating an interconnected, frictionless shopping experience that enables our customers to seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds.\"\n",

      "*   **Advertising Revenue Dependence:** A significant portion of Alphabet's revenue comes from advertising, making them vulnerable to reduced spending by advertisers or technologies that block ads.\n",
      "*   **Investments in New Businesses:** Ongoing investments in new businesses, products, services, and technologies are inherently risky and could divert management attention and harm financial results.\n",
      "*   **Intellectual Property Protection:** Inability to protect intellectual property rights could reduce the value of products, services, and brands.\n",
      "*   **Data Privacy and Security:** Data privacy and security concerns could harm their reputation and deter users from using their products and services. They face cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to their systems regularly.\n",
      "*   **International Operations:** International operations expose Alphabet to risks such as restrictions on foreign ownership, sanctions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n",

      "*   **Competition:** Amazon faces intense competition across various industries and geographies, including physical, e-commerce, and cloud services.\n",
      "*   **Expansion into New Areas:** Expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects Amazon to additional risks, including limited experience and potential customer rejection.\n",
      "*   **International Operations:** International operations expose Amazon to risks such as local economic and political conditions, government regulations, and restrictions on foreign ownership.\n",
      "*   **Variability in Retail Business:** The variability in the retail business places increased strain on operations due to fluctuating demand and seasonality.\n",
      "*   **Fraudulent Activities of Sellers:** Amazon is impacted by fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers, which can harm their business and reputation.\n",
      "*   **Intellectual Property Rights:** Risks related to adequately protecting their intellectual property rights and being accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\n",
      "*   **Foreign Exchange Risk:** Amazon has foreign exchange risk due to its international operations.\n",
      "*   **Data Loss or Security Breaches:** Could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches.\n",
      "*   **System Interruption:** Faces risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy.\n",

      "Over the past three years, Home Depot has refined its description of its business, with notable changes in its strategic focus, customer segmentation, and emphasis on interconnected shopping experiences, sustainability, and human capital management.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strategic Focus:**\n",
      "*   **2022:** The company emphasized agility in response to a fluid business environment, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, highlighting investments in creating an interconnected, frictionless shopping experience. Their goals were centered around providing the best customer experience, being the low-cost provider, and being the most efficient investor of capital.\n",
      "*   **2023:** Home Depot acknowledged a year of moderation after unprecedented growth, navigating a shift in consumer spending towards services and the impact of rising interest rates. The strategy remained focused on an interconnected shopping experience and the same three key goals as in 2022.\n",
      "*   **2025:** The company noted continued pressure on home improvement demand due to high interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty. The focus remained on strategic investments for an interconnected shopping experience, growing market share with Pros, and building new stores, with the same three core goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Customer Segmentation:**\n",
      "*   Across all three years (2022, 2023, and 2025), Home Depot consistently identified two primary customer groups: DIY (Do-It-Yourself) customers and Professional customers (Pros). They also consistently mention DIFM (Do-It-For-Me) customers as an intersection between DIY customers and Pros.\n",
      "*   **2025:** Home Depot specifically mentions the acquisition of SRS, a leading residential specialty trade distribution company, to better serve Pro customers, particularly roofers, landscapers, and pool contractors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Interconnected Shopping Experience:**\n",
      "*   Across the years, Home Depot has consistently emphasized enhancing the interconnected shopping experience.\n",
      "*   **2022:** They highlighted investments in their website and mobile apps to enhance the digital customer experience, noting that a significant majority of traffic in their digital channels comes from mobile devices.\n",
      "*   **2023:** The company continued to focus on digital experience enhancements, emphasizing simplicity and relevancy in digital interactions for mobile customers.\n",
      "*   **2025:** Home Depot emphasized providing a frictionless interconnected shopping experience across stores, online, on the job site, and in customers' homes, with a focus on investments in websites and mobile apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sustainability and Human Capital Management:**\n",
      "*   **2022:** Home Depot formally organized their environmental, social, and governance efforts around three pillars: Focus on Our People, Operate Sustainably, and Strengthen Our Communities.\n",
      "*   **2023:** They reiterated their commitment to corporate responsibility, stating that ESG is fundamentally embedded in their operations and culture, organized around the same three pillars.\n",
      "*   **2025:** Home Depot continued to emphasize these three pillars, viewing sustainability and human capital management through the lens of their business, with initiatives embedded in their business strategy.\n",
